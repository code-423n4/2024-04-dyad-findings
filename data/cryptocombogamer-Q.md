1. **Inheritance of the wrong constructor for `Owned`**:
   The abstract contract is incorrectly trying to pass an argument to the `Owned` contract through inheritance. In Solidity, you pass arguments to a base contract constructor directly in the constructor of the derived contract, not in the inheritance list. The correct way to do it is to call the `Owned` constructor inside the `KerosineVault` constructor and pass the owner address there. Here's the fixed code:
   
   ```solidity
   abstract contract KerosineVault is IVault, Owned {
     constructor(
       IVaultManager _vaultManager,
       ERC20 _asset, 
       KerosineManager _kerosineManager 
     ) Owned(msg.sender) {
       // constructor body with additional initializations if necessary
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Missing `Deposit` and `Move` events**:
   Both `Deposit` and `Move` events have to be declared before they can be emitted in Solidity. These events facilitate logging and are useful for off-chain applications to track certain transactions on-chain. Here's the corrected code including the event declarations:

   ```solidity
   event Deposit(uint indexed id, uint amount);
   event Move(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint amount);

   // ... rest of the contract code ...

   // Inside the relevant functions where these events should be emitted
   emit Deposit(id, amount);
   emit Move(from, to, amount);
   ```

It's critical for these declarations to exist somewhere within the contract or in one of its base contracts. The names of the parameters in the event emissions should match the names of the parameters in the event declarations. Furthermore, if you want to index parameters to allow for easier searching, you can do so by using the `indexed` keyword in the event declaration, as shown in the example above. Remember, you can have up to three indexed parameters per event in Solidity. 

Make sure that the rest of your contract logic properly supports and corresponds to these events, and that the events are emitted in the correct places within your functions to accurately reflect the actions taking place.
