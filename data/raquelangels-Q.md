Upon reviewing the provided Solidity code for the `KerosineManager` contract, here are some observations that may be considered bugs or areas for improvement:

1. **Version Locking**: The contract is locked to a specific version of the Solidity compiler (0.8.17), which is generally a good practice to prevent unexpected behavior from compiler updates. However, it is essential to update the compiler version regularly to benefit from optimizations and security fixes.

2. **Error Message Consistency**: The custom errors (`TooManyVaults`, `VaultAlreadyAdded`, `VaultNotFound`) provide clear messages in case of a failed operation, which helps with debugging and user feedback. This is a good practice.

3. **Function Visibility**: The `add` and `remove` functions are correctly restricted to the contract owner by using the `onlyOwner` modifier from the imported `Owned` contract. This adheres to the control pattern typically used for administrative functions.

4. **Usage of EnumerableSet**: The contract uses the `EnumerableSet` library from OpenZeppelin, which is a well-tested and community-trusted library. However, there is potential for gas optimization by avoiding the use of `EnumerableSet` for simple use cases, as the library's functions may have higher gas
