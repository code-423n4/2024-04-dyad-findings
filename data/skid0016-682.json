  "title": "### [M-02] Dangerous Strict Equality Check in `withdraw` Function  **Description:** The `withdraw` function in the `VaultManagerV2` contract checks whether a withdrawal is being attempted in the same block where a deposit occurred. This is achieved through a strict equality check:  ```Javascript if (idToBlockOfLastDeposit[id] == block.number) revert DepositedInSameBlock(); ``` Strict equality checks like this can be risky because of the high likelihood of state changes, especially in complex systems with external interactions. This check could lead to unintended revertions, potentially disrupting expected behavior.",
