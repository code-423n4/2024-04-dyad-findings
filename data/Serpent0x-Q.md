Contract Path:src/core/Vault.kerosine.unbounded.sol

Audit Findings:


Line 44-51: External Contract Interaction:

The contract interacts with external contracts (kerosineManager, Vault, Dyad, kerosineDenominator) to retrieve data such as vault balances, asset prices, and denominators.

Failure to properly handle errors or inconsistencies in these external contract interactions may result in unreliable or inaccurate data, potentially compromising the integrity and functionality of the contract.

Line 53-55: Arithmetic Operations:

The assetPrice function performs arithmetic operations to calculate the total value locked (TVL) and asset price. However, these operations may introduce risks of arithmetic overflow or underflow errors if not handled properly.

Without proper validation and error handling mechanisms, arithmetic errors could lead to inaccurate or unexpected results, undermining the reliability and security of the contract's calculations.



Recommendations:

Implement Error Handling: Add robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle failures or inconsistencies in external contract interactions. Validate return values and include informative error messages to ensure the reliability and security of the contract's operations.

Use SafeMath: Utilize SafeMath or equivalent mechanisms to perform arithmetic operations safely and prevent potential overflow or underflow errors. This will ensure the integrity of the contract's calculations and protect against unexpected behavior.
