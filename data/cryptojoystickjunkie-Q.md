VaultManagerV2.sol
1. Initializable without ownership checks:
   The `setKeroseneManager` function is external and limits access to only be called before any other function (initializer), but it does not restrict who can call it. This could lead to a situation where an unauthorized user sets the `keroseneManager`. You probably want to add an onlyOwner modifier or similar access control.

2. Reentrancy concerns:
   The `withdraw` function calls external contracts via `_vault.asset().safeTransferFrom` and `_vault.withdraw`. Ensure that the `Vault` contract has adequate protection against reentrancy attacks, especially because `collatRatio` is calculated after these external calls.

3. Validation after effects:
   The `withdraw` and `mintDyad` functions perform important state changes and only afterwards validate the new collateralization ratio, which could put the contract in a temporary invalid state if the function is reverted. It's usually better practice to perform all necessary checks prior to making any state changes.

4. Collateral Ratio Calculation:
   With floating point math and rounding errors, you need to be careful about the `collatRatio` returning exactly `MIN_COLLATERIZATION_RATIO`. It might be safer to use `<=` instead of `<` when checking collateral ratio in required conditions to avoid off-by-one errors due to rounding.

5. Public visibility used for external-only functions:
   The `withdraw` function is marked as `public`, which means it can be called internally. If this is not the desired behavior or necessary, you might want to mark it as `external` to save a bit of gas and clarify the intention of use.

6. Use of uninitialized storage in `liquidate`:
   The `liquidate` function reads from `vaults[id].at(i)`, assuming vaults have been properly initialized and set. If a vault at a given index has not been set, this could result in undesired behavior. It’s important to ensure that the data structure is always in a valid state before accessing its values.

7. Dependence on External Contracts:
   This contract depends on several external contracts (`Vault`, `ERC20`, etc.). Any changes or vulnerabilities in these contracts may propagate to this contract. It is essential to ensure that these external contracts are secure.

8. Lack of event emission on state-changing transactions:
   The best practice for auditing purposes and transparency is to emit events whenever the state changes (such as in setKeroseneManager). There’s currently no event being emitted when the KeroseneManager is set, which could be important for tracking changes to the contract state.

9. Error handling:
   The contract relies heavily on custom revert conditions. While this can be useful for debugging, it also means that any changes to these conditions must be carefully managed to avoid incorrect error triggers.

10. getKeroseneValue and getNonKeroseneValue repetition:
    There's a lot of duplicated logic between `getKeroseneValue` and `getNonKeroseneValue`. Consider refactoring into a single function that works with both cases. This reduces code duplication and potential for missed updates in the logic.
