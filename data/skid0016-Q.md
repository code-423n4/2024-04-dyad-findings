### [I-01] Improve Naming Conventions for Storage and Immutable Variables

**Description:**
In Solidity codebases, variable naming conventions are essential for code readability, maintainability, and reducing the likelihood of errors. Using consistent prefixes for storage and immutable variables helps distinguish between them at a glance, aiding in understanding and debugging. The current codebase does not follow consistent naming conventions for storage and immutable variables, which might lead to confusion for developers and auditors.

**Impact:**
- **Readability:** Inconsistent naming conventions can make it harder for developers and auditors to understand the purpose and scope of a variable.
- **Maintainability:** Proper naming conventions reduce the risk of misinterpretation when modifying or extending the codebase.
- **Debugging:** Clear conventions help identify variable types and their expected behavior, simplifying troubleshooting.

**Proof of Concept:**
In the codebase, storage and immutable variables do not follow a consistent naming convention. This can be seen in the following example from the `VaultManagerV2` contract:

```javascript
DNft public immutable dNft;  // Immutable variable
Dyad public immutable dyad;  // Immutable variable
Licenser public immutable vaultLicenser;  // Immutable variable

mapping(uint => EnumerableSet.AddressSet) internal vaults;  // Storage variable
```
In this example, there's no clear indication that `vaults` is a storage variable or that `dNft`, `dyad`, and `vaultLicenser` are immutable variables.

**Recommended Mitigation:** To improve readability and maintainability, consider adopting a consistent naming convention for storage and immutable variables. A common approach is to prefix storage variables with `s_` and immutable variables with `i_`. This convention makes it easier to identify the variable's purpose at a glance.

Here's an example of how you might refactor the code to follow this convention:

```javascript
    DNft public immutable i_dNft;
Dyad public immutable i_dyad;
Licenser public immutable i_vaultLicenser;

mapping(uint => EnumerableSet.AddressSet) internal s_vaults;

```
This change would improve code clarity and aid future developers in understanding the structure of the codebase.
