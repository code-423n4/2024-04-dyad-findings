### [G-01] External Calls Within a Loop (Gas Inefficiency)

**Description:** 
The `VaultManagerV2` contract has a pattern where external calls are made within a loop. Specifically, in the `getNonKeroseneValue` function, there is an external call to `vaultLicenser.isLicensed(address(vault))` in each iteration of the loop. This design can lead to higher gas costs due to multiple external calls, which could be avoided by caching the results or rethinking the loop structure.

**Impact:** 
- **Higher Gas Costs**: Repeated external calls within a loop significantly increase transaction gas costs, potentially making some operations prohibitively expensive.
- **Reduced Efficiency**: Increased gas consumption reduces the contract's overall efficiency, affecting its usability in real-world scenarios.

**Proof of Concept:**
In the following snippet, the external call to `vaultLicenser.isLicensed(address(vault))` occurs within a loop, increasing gas consumption with each iteration:

```javascript
function getNonKeroseneValue(uint id) public view returns (uint) {
    uint totalUsdValue;
    uint numberOfVaults = vaults[id].length(); 
    for (uint i = 0; i < numberOfVaults; i++) {
        Vault vault = Vault(vaults[id].at(i));
        if (vaultLicenser.isLicensed(address(vault))) {  // External call within loop
            totalUsdValue += vault.getUsdValue(id);
        }
    }
    return totalUsdValue;
}
```
**Recommended Mitigation:** To reduce gas costs and improve efficiency, consider the following:

*   **Cache External Results**: Before entering the loop, cache the results of external calls to avoid repetitive interactions.
*   **Restructure the Loop**: Minimize or eliminate external calls within the loop, if possible.

The following refactor demonstrates caching the license status before entering the loop, reducing repeated external calls:

```javascript
    function getNonKeroseneValue(uint id) public view returns (uint) {
    uint totalUsdValue;
    uint numberOfVaults = vaults[id].length();
    bool[] memory isLicensed = new bool[](numberOfVaults);

    // Cache license status
    for (uint i = 0; i < numberOfVaults; i++) {
        Vault vault = Vault(vaults[id].at(i));
        isLicensed[i] = vaultLicenser.isLicensed(address(vault));
    }

    // Now use cached results to calculate total USD value
    for (uint i = 0; i < numberOfVaults; i++) {
        if (isLicensed[i]) {
            Vault vault = Vault(vaults[id].at(i));
            totalUsdValue += vault.getUsdValue(id);
        }
    }
    return totalUsdValue;
}

```

Implementing these mitigations can significantly reduce gas costs and improve the contract's efficiency.

**Note**: The following functions also have external calls within a loop:

*   `VaultManagerV2::getNonKeroseneValue`
*   `VaultManagerV2::getKeroseneValue`
*   `Vault.kerosine.unbounded::assetPrice`

### [G-02] Non-Immutable Variable in `KerosineDenominator` (Optimization Impact)

**Description:**
The `KerosineDenominator` contract has a `Kerosine` reference named `kerosine` that is initialized in the constructor and does not change afterward. In Solidity, variables that are set in the constructor and remain constant can be marked as `immutable`. Using `immutable` reduces gas costs during contract execution and indicates to readers that the variable's value won't change.

**Impact:**
- **Gas Costs:** Marking a variable as `immutable` can lower gas costs for reads and ensure the variable value is known at compile time, leading to optimization.
- **Clarity:** The `immutable` keyword makes it clear that a variable is set once and won't change, improving the code's readability and maintainability.

**Proof of Concept:**
```javascript
contract KerosineDenominator is Parameters {
  Kerosine public kerosine;

  constructor(
    Kerosine _kerosine
  ) {
    kerosine = _kerosine;
  }

  function denominator() external view returns (uint) {
    return kerosine.totalSupply() - kerosine.balanceOf(MAINNET_OWNER);
  } 
}
```
In this code snippet, `kerosine` is set in the constructor and doesn't change, indicating it should be marked as `immutable`.

**Recommended Mitigation:** To improve gas efficiency and provide clarity, mark the `kerosine` variable as `immutable`. This change can reduce the gas cost for read operations and make it clear that this variable's value won't change after initialization.

```javascript
    contract KerosineDenominator is Parameters {
  Kerosine public immutable kerosine;  // Marked as immutable

  constructor(
    Kerosine _kerosine
  ) {
    kerosine = _kerosine;
  }

  function denominator() external view returns (uint) {
    return kerosine.totalSupply() - kerosine.balanceOf(MAINNET_OWNER);
  } 
}

```
This change adds the `immutable` keyword to `kerosine`, indicating that the value is set once and never changes, leading to better gas efficiency and clarity.
