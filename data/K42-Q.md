### QA Report for [DYAD](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-dyad/tree/main) by K42

- I made sure these are unique in relation to the ``4naly3er`` report.

[KerosineDenominator](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-dyad/blob/main/src/staking/KerosineDenominator.sol):
Low Severity:
- 1. The `denominator` function lacks specific input validation for the `MAINNET_OWNER` address. Consider adding a check to ensure it is not the zero address.
   **Solution**: Add a ``require`` statement to check if `MAINNET_OWNER` is not the zero address.

Non-Critical:
- 1. The `denominator` function can be better simplified by directly returning the result of the subtraction.
   **Solution**: Modify the function to `return kerosine.totalSupply() - kerosine.balanceOf(MAINNET_OWNER);`.

[VaultManagerV2](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-dyad/blob/main/src/core/VaultManagerV2.sol):
Low Severity:
- 1. The `add` and `addKerosene` functions also lack input validation for the `vault` parameter. Consider adding a check to ensure it is not the zero address and is a contract address.
   **Solution**: Add a require statement to check if `vault` is not the zero address and is a contract address using `address(vault).code.length > 0`.

- 2. The `remove` and `removeKerosene` functions allow removing a vault even if it has assets. This may eventually lead to unexpected behaviour or loss of funds.
   **Solution**: Consider adding a specific check to prevent removing a vault if it still holds assets.

- 3. The `deposit` function does not check if the `vault` is a valid vault address.
   **Solution**: Add a specific check to ensure that the `vault` is a valid vault address before performing the deposit.

Non-Critical:
- 1. The `DepositedInSameBlock` error is not defined in the contract. Define the error to improve clarity and consistency.
   **Solution**: Define the `DepositedInSameBlock` error in the contract.

- 2. The `Initializable` contract is imported but not used. Remove the unused import to improve code readability.
   **Solution**: Remove the unused import statement for `Initializable`.

- 3. The `idToBlockOfLastDeposit` mapping is not used in the `deposit` function.
   **Solution**: Consider removing the `idToBlockOfLastDeposit` mapping if it is not needed.

[KerosineManager](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-dyad/blob/main/src/core/KerosineManager.sol):
Low Severity:
- 1. The `add` function also lacks input validation for the `vault` parameter. Consider adding a check to ensure it is not the zero address and is a contract address.
   **Solution**: Add a require statement to check if `vault` is not the zero address and is a contract address using `address(vault).code.length > 0`.

Non-Critical:
- 1. The `VaultAlreadyAdded` error message is not descriptive enough. Consider providing more information about the vault that was already added.
   **Solution**: Update the error message to include the address of the vault that was already added.

- 2. The `remove` function does not emit an event when a vault is removed.
   **Solution**: Consider emitting an event when a vault is successfully removed to improve transparency.

[BoundedKerosineVault](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-dyad/blob/main/src/core/Vault.kerosine.bounded.sol):
Low Severity:
- 1. The `assetPrice` function relies on the `unboundedKerosineVault` contract, which may not be set or could be changed unexpectedly. Consider adding specific checks to ensure the contract is properly initialized and immutable.
   **Solution**: Add a require statement to check if `unboundedKerosineVault` is properly initialized and consider making it immutable.

- 2. The `setUnboundedKerosineVault` function allows setting the `unboundedKerosineVault` to the zero address.
   **Solution**: Add a check to ensure that the `_unboundedKerosineVault` address is not the zero address.

Non-Critical:
- 1. The `NotWithdrawable` error is not used consistently in the contract.
   **Solution**: Consider removing the `NotWithdrawable` error if it is not needed or use it consistently.

[UnboundedKerosineVault](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-dyad/blob/main/src/core/Vault.kerosine.unbounded.sol):
Low Severity:
- 1. The `assetPrice` function iterates over an unbounded array of vaults, which may lead to high gas consumption or potential denial of service if the number of vaults grows large.
   **Solution**: Consider implementing pagination or limiting the number of vaults processed in a single call to mitigate the risk.

- 2. The `setDenominator` function allows setting the `kerosineDenominator` to the zero address.
   **Solution**: Add a check to ensure that the `_kerosineDenominator` address is not the zero address.

Non-Critical:
- 1. The `assetPrice` function lacks proper error handling for cases where the `denominator` is zero. Consider adding a check to prevent division by zero.
   **Solution**: Add a require statement to check if the `denominator` is not zero before performing the division.
